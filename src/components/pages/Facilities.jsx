              Learning by Doing
              Our science lab gives students the opportunity to learn through observation and experimentation. It is equipped with basic tools and models for understanding key concepts in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Under the guidance of subject teachers, students carry out simple experiments that connect directly with their textbooks. The lab encourages practical learning, critical thinking, and a better grasp of scientific principles through realÂ experiences.

              Our classrooms are simple yet thoughtfully arranged to ensure every student feels comfortable and focused. With ample natural light, proper ventilation, and neat seating arrangements, they offer a calm and organized space for learning. The blackboards, charts, and student-made displays on the walls help create a connection between lessons and real-life understanding. Teachers use engaging methods, including discussions and group work, to make lessons meaningful and interactive.
